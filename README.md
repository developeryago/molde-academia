<h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Client Request:</h3> <br>

I have a gym that has several modalities, such as: Bodybuilding, fights, dances, HIIT, indoor bike, Functional, Jump and others.
I would like to have a page that is attractive to customers and that shows all my modalities so that they get to know a little better what we have to offer.

The page should show testimonials from students who went through the academy and had results. In addition, it must also show our instructors that they are professionals and well-recognized athletes in the market.

Other services we offer are:

Physical assessment with bioimpedance and personalized training, Physiotherapy for treatment and prevention of injuries and Follow-up with a personal trainer.

These services can be contracted individually and are not included in the monthly fee.

Through this page, potential customers should be able to send messages to clear up doubts and students should be able to access registration information and view their training information.

The main colors of the academy are Black and Yellow, so I would like the page to follow this color pattern. An important detail is that the design needs to be modern, elegant and demonstrate all the quality of the services we offer. Our equipment is all new and we have renowned professionals in the market to guide students in all activities.
